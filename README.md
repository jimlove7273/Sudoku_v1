# React Sudoku v1
Everyone plays Sudoku, including me.  However I went ahead and create a Sudoku game in React.  In this version 1.0 of the popular Sudoku game I created using React, TypeScript, and CSS.  It has the following features

- This is an example, so there are only two games that can be played (default on the first one)
- Each game has a puzzle line and a solution line.  Every time an user pieces a cell and place a value, it is checked against the solution to see if the user makes a correct choice.  If so, it shows the number in blue color and no longer changeable. Otherwise it's shown in red and the number can be changed again until a correct number is entered.
- You will know the game is over when all the boxes are filled with either black (default) color or blue (entered correctly).  There is no separate result tracker.

#### You can check it out the code and play the game if you wish.

Don't forget to let me know if you liked my work.
